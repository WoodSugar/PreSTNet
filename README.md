# PreSTNet
Source Code of the PreSTNet (Pre-trained Spatio-Temporal Network for Traffic Forecasting).

This repository is being updated. 

## We have provided the following information for reproducibility
1. Hyper-parameter settings in pre-training and fine-tuning phases
2. Pre-trained backbone on three evaluation datasets (SubwayBJ, TaxiBJ, and PeMS03)
3. Pre-processed data of the open-source PeMS03 dataset (saved on Google Drive)

## More details is on the way including
1. Model structure
2. Training log file
3. Visualization result

## We are sorry that the following data cannot be provided due to the commercial copyright agreement
1. Original and pre-processed data of SubwayBJ dataset
2. Original and pre-processed data of TaxiBJ dataset

## Acknowledgement
We appreciate the EasyTorch and BasicTS toolboxes to support this work.
